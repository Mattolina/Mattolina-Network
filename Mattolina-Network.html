  <span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #e03e2d; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Welcome to my deepweb website my name is Matthew Vega. I love tech so much, as a kid I was into toys not tech. But later down the line I became into how tech works, because my passion was very high for working with any tech. I've dealt with some challenges as for myself working with computers like 
    <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">braking things on purpose</span> it wasn't easy for me to say, thus I wanted to reprogram my deepweb website with new updates and news. I would do sofor me to bring news about myself especially, on the myself of what I'm planning to do for my business and etc. I hope one day I can show what I'm worth since, I'm into programing websites which are pretty cool indeed. Otherwise I also love tech because the benefit it has on humanity to make more intelligent decisions to evolve over time. 
    <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">The Technology is amazing and the thing I wish to do is go to Japan to see the advance tech</span> over there and explore the world around it which would be pretty cool indeed I've learn a lot from experience working with tech. I hope things goes pretty much right for my self indeed. I'm glad that I know how to program things on the computer which is amazing and sweet.

  <span style="font-size: 18pt;"> 
    <span style="color: #e03e2d; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">The plan's for myself is to find a place to settle and learn to program so I can be successful thus I learn a lot from experience, I just hope things go according to plan which would be pretty amazing indeed. Otherwise, I hope for the best for myself thus I invest in myself to show that 
      <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">I've been working smart thus being a kid with unique powers is not easy. When it comes to great power comes with great responsibility.</span> I use to misunderstood of what my Mom says for no reason. I'm so lucky that my Mother dispite my mental health. My Mom always supported my career &amp; passion. I love building websites for people and my family. 
      <span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Anyways though I hoping the Covid-19 Virus goes away and everything goes back to normal which would be pretty amazing. </span>Lastly the last future thing to dream of would be to give back to the world to help human's strive for more innovation in the human race.

          <strong>March 26th 2022 as of writing this. Update welcome to Mattolina Network hope you doing fine. I'm working towards investing in my self to learn programing and software development and website development which would be great indeed. But I know they're would be challenges to tackle over time like dealing with a LLC, Taxes, Money and Bill's which would be pretty much a pain a lot. However I would make my peers proud indeed and my family too which I'm not giving up on that dream over these time to either get a cheap Job or follow your career. Well I choose to follow my career indeed and that is become a Mattnoply indeed of open source software where it's about the freedom and the open source of Software and Software Development of course. Hopefully it really can grow over time in a time span of course. Thus I learn a lot from school about investing and other things like writing format to be able write the website correctly. To thus fix any spell errors etc. The other thing that makes me happy is the way I challenge my self to great a website which on the deep web is how I created it by learning from the world wide web. But the thing is we own less and less I believe in onwership of Software, Hardware, and your own life indeed. Thus I realized the problems of not owning anything more like renting stuff which is out of this world crazy like cold bricks on a snow day. But another thing on Mattolina Network news is that any government spyies on you or even especially your device which is like renting a microphone in your per say dorm room for instance. </strong>
        </span>
      </span>
      <span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #f1c40f;">
        <span style="font-size: 18pt; background-color: #f1c40f;">
          <strong>Let's see how the government spies on your device well if you read the Edward Snowden leaks about the NSA would explain more about it in detail also in his book. You have a door in your room right? You care about what you do in your room like privacy right. Well the people that explains this is false don't know the reality. Your phone has a IMEI number that is burn in the handset. No matter what phone you switch too it would always be burned to the phone. The sim card is a type of device to let you use their network with your subscription you use from the celluar service provider.</strong>
        </span>
      </span>
      <span style="color: #e03e2d;">
        <span style="font-size: 18pt;">
          <strong> Your phone that you buy or should say don't own like rent it for texting or calling use a type of network called celluar towers which tracks every movement of the celluar connection of which you go combine together your ISP to even when you disconnect from celluar. Well your connected to WiFi and so this would lead to your ip address being still on the network despite turning off celluar networks. So people explains to me why don't you shut down the phone. So I come back to this how 
            <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">you know the phone is really off I mean it.</span>
          </strong>
        </span>
      </span>
    </span>
    <span style="font-size: 18pt; background-color: #f1c40f;">
      <span style="color: #e03e2d; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Your phone dispite being off can be tracked and be traced back to the owner. Because he or she or other pay with her credit/debit card. Even if you pay with cash they still got your account number. But the phone being off is not the worry it's the constant pinging of celluar and wiFi Networks saying</span>

    <strong>
      <em>
        <span style="color: #e03e2d;">After the celluar device pings then it makes a call to your phone. Not to mention ISP and Celluar companies are keeping logs on what you do on the internet and even use that data to see something useful in the future over is it obviously some people dosen't realize how much data is more in vaule over time since the loging and they can use this data to exploit people in differnt places for reason or even no reason. But why as Mattolina LLC care so much about privacy. It's because we lost ownership of the device we own we as a society need to make a change this one limit uploading data to social media unless you have to. Another thing too is support open source developers and lastly try or even use open source software it becomes better. As of hardware just support the right to repair movement so you be able freely fix and build hardware without drm or bricking software from corporations. I wanted to make this website to support the open source community over these things of course and give my trust with software that you own not rent from a corporation with a shaddy terms of service thank you Daisy Mario Tech and I'm out and thank you for continue support. One last thing check out </span>
